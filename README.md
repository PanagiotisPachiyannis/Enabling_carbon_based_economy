# Enabling_carbon_based_economy
The repository of my FYP at Imperial College London: Enabling a Carbon-Based Economy Through Data

The folder /bloomberg contains all files associated with obtaining data from Bloomberg and processing it.
The API classes are included under /bloomberg/blpapi_java_3.19.1.1 for convenience. More information on the API: https://www.bloomberg.com/professional/support/api-library/.
The fild 'BloombergMain' contains the code which utilises the Bloomberg API. It will not run on a machine unless there is a Bloomberg Terminal running (you need to be logged in).

The rest of the files are for machine learning and statistics and are named accordingly.
