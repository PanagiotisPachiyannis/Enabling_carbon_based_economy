# Unittests

## Mktnotifier
The `mktnotifier` directory contains tests for the `mktnotifer` application.

## Snippets
The `snippets` package contains snippets of code that can be used as building
blocks for your own tests.  While they don't represent a real life application,
they can be compiled by following the same instructions used for the
`mktnotifier` application.

It contains the following directories:
- `EventGlossaryTest`: tests for handling various messages created by the SDK
- `Resolver`: tests for various events related to resolution
- `Refdata`: tests for handling messages for the `//blp/refdata` service
