# Snippets

The `eventglossarytests` package contains example code for building all
messages that the SDK will create and deliver to the application. Messages
generated by other services (including infrastructure Bloomberg services like
'//blp/apiauth') are not shown here. These tests do not correspond to any
source code.

The `resolver` package contains two examples of interactions between an
application and the SDK. The examples show service registration for a
resolution service and handling of a permission request.

The `refdata` package contains tests for creating responses to the
`//blp/refdata` service. The schema for the responses is dynamically created
based on the data in the request. Applications cannot just use the schema of
the service to create mock responses in their own tests.  Instead, each test
needs to create the schema that corresponds to the response that will be
delivered. These tests do not correspond to any source code.
